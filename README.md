## What are we doing?

Help Me Invest! is a project that aims to to make it easy to for individuals to understand what investments really are and how they work. Its basically a web application that allows a user to enter a breakdown of their finances anonymously without the need to create any account or the fear of being tracked. 

Based upon the breakdown provided by the user, the application automatically provides suggestions on how the user can go about investing their hard earned money and/or other assets to gain the maximum returns out of it. The application would not store any user data to any database whatsoever and would work by making real-time suggestions to users and allowing them to download the suggestions report to a PDF document or a spreadsheet once they are done. If a user wishes to return to update their investment reports in the future, they can do so by simply feeding their earlier generated investment report to the system and the application would read the data off the document and allow the user to make  changes.

## How is it different?

There are a lot of existing websites and applications providing similar services, however, there are no concrete open source tools which do this at the moment while not tracking user data. The focus here would be solely on helping the users understand how to invest their resources without having to worry about any data leaks and privacy concerns.

Since no data is stored anywhere outside of the user's control the risk of any user data leakage from the system is nullified, effectively ensuring data security to the user.

## Who are we?

This project is an initiative by [Sayak Sarkar][link_sayak-sarkar] to consolidate investment options related data across multiple geopolitical locations around the world.

The development of this project is mentored by [Andrea Ferrero][link_andrea], who is the co-founder of Pockets Change, where she works with students, families, and teachers across the country to change the way finance is taught..

[Sayak][link_sayak-sarkar] is an invited member of the [Open Leaders Cohort 6][link_openleaderscohort] of the [Mozilla Foundation][link_mozfoundation]. The [Open Leadership Series][link_mozopenleadership] is designed to teach leaders about the best practices in “working open”. Essentially focused on how to build and effectively engage communities so they can work together to develop tools and resources for the greater good.

## What do we need?

**You**! In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in financial investments (globally as well as locally), app development, user experience design, database maintenance for data dictionaries(particularly ensuring the highest quality data protection plans are in place), software sustainability, documentation and technical writing and project management. We'd love your feedback along the way.

Our primary goal is to create a tool which would be created by the community, for the community and is of the community; the suggestions which would be made by the tool would be completely sourced in the open from the community. This is where everyone can help in creating a set of open decentralized data dictionaries for the tool to run off.
